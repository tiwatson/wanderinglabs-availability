Wanderinglabs Availability
================

## NEW UPDATED VERSION - https://github.com/tiwatson/wandering-labs-availability-2 
## This is an old out dated rails project. See above for the new nodejs based hotness. 

Application that scrapes Reserve America according to queries provided by the end users. Looks for open campsites then notifies them via email.

Useful for when wanting to camp at a fully booked campground. If someone else cancels their reservation, this app will let you know so you may then book it.

See it in action (http://reserve.wanderinglabs.com)

-----------

Scraping goes down like so:

- Get request made to campground page to set session (LocationConnection)
- Post request made to campground page to set filters (LocationFilter)
- Multiple get requests made for next availability (LocationScraper)
